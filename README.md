# UO<sub>2</sub>-Sigma3-and-Sigma11-GBs
Computational details of 'Effect of fission products on tensile strength of UO<sub>2</sub> Σ3 (111)/[1 $\overline{\text{1}}$ 0] and UO<sub>2</sub> Σ11 (1 $\overline{\text{1}}$ 3)/[110] grain boundaries from first-principles study'

The input files include POSCAR, KPOINTS, and INCAR. The two INCAR files are respectively the initial and final files for structural optimization with *U* Ramping method.

The example folder includes both the input and output files of pure UO<sub>2</sub> sigma3 grain boundary.
